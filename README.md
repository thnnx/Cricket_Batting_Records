# Overview
This project was created for my preparation on focusing on data analyst roles. This helped me practice and apply all the skills I've learned from Data Analysis courses and tutorials. The project will focus on Data Cleaning using Python and Data Transformation and Visualization using Power BI.

The data sourced from sports website [ESPN Cricket section](https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/highest-career-batting-average-282910) and tutorial from a youtube channel (Ryan & Matt Data Science) on data analysis. Data contains a records of highest career batting average in history. It consists of players name and their country, years and matches played, and personal cricket records.

Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as average career length of the player, batting strike rate, players who played the most and number of players per country

# Questions

These are the questions I want to answer in my project:

1. What is the career average length?
2. What is the average batting strike rate for player who played more than 10 years in the league?
3. How many players played cricket even before the cricket league was established (1960)?
4. Max highest innings score by country
5. What are the averages of Hundreds, Fifties, Ducks (0) by country

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **MS Excel:** Importing the datasets from a website and saving as a csv file.
- **Python:** For data cleaning and manipulation. I also used the following Python libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** Data analysis and cleaning.
    - **Matplotlib Library:** simple and quick data visualization for analyzing data irregularities.
    - **Numpy Library:** Numerical calculation (Pandas backbone).
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My ide for executing my Python scripts.
- **Power BI (Power Query)** Used for data transformation (power query) and interactive data visualization for deeper Data analysis insights.
