# Cricket Batting Records Data Analysis

This project was created for my preparation on focusing on data analyst roles. This helped me practice and apply all the skills I've learned from Data Analysis courses and tutorials. The project will focus on Data Cleaning using Python and Data Transformation and Visualization using Power BI.

The data sourced from sports website [ESPN Cricket section](https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/highest-career-batting-average-282910) and tutorial from a youtube channel (Ryan & Matt Data Science) on data analysis. Data contains a records of highest career batting average in history. It consists of players name and their country, years and matches played, and personal cricket records.

Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as average career length of the player, batting strike rate, players who played the most and number of players per country
